# Episode 0: A New Terminal

A long time ago in a Unix environment far, far away, young Jedi padawans who
knew only of desktop software were seduced by the dark side of the Force to
enter… The Terminal.

Follow the instructions below using all the console commands introduced in
Fundamentals, class, or that you find on your own.

## Set the Scene

1. Enter your homework directory and clone this homework. 
2. Enter the directory you just cloned
3. Create a new directory called "**galaxy_far_far_away**" and enter it.
4. Create a directory called "**death_star**", and make the following files inside of it:
* "**darth_vader.txt**"
* "**princess_leia.txt**"
* "**storm_trooper.txt**"
5. In "**galaxy_far_far_away**", make a directory named "**tatooine**" and create the following files in it:
* "**luke.txt**"
* "**ben_kenobi.txt**"
6. Inside of "**tatooine**" make a directory called "**millenium_falcon**", and in it create:
* "**han_solo.txt**"
* "**chewbaca.txt**"

## Part I

1. Rename "**ben_kenobi.txt**" to "**obi_wan.txt**".

5. Move "**millenium_falcon**" into "**death_star**".
6. Move "**princess_leia.txt**" into the "**millenium_falcon**".
7. Delete "**obi_wan.txt**".
8. In "**galaxy_far_far_away**", make a directory called "**yavin_4**".
9. Move the "**millenium_falcon**" out of the "**death_star**" and into "**yavin_4**".
10. Make a directory in "**yavin_4**" called "**x_wing**".
11. Move "**princess_leia.txt**" to "**yavin_4**" and "**luke.txt**" to "**x_wing**".

## Part II

1. Move the "**millenium_falcon**" and "**x_wing**" out of "**yavin_4**" and into "**galaxy_far_far_away**".
2. In "**death_star**", create directories for "**tie_fighter_1**", "**tie_fighter_2**" and "**tie_fighter_3**".
3. Move "**darth_vader.txt**" into "**tie_fighter_1**".
4. Make a copy of "**storm_trooper.txt**" in both "**tie_fighter_2**" and "**tie_fighter_3**".
5. Move all of the "**tie_fighters**" out of the "**death_star**" and into "**galaxy_far_far_away**".
6. Explode "**tie_fighters**" 2 and 3.
7. Touch a file in "**x_wing**" called "**the_force.txt**".
8. Destroy the "**death_star**" and anyone inside of it.
